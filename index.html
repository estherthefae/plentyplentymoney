                Take this as a bit of a love letter from me. 💌<br>
                I remember the very first time I saw you in CU, when you volunteered to be a course
                rep and in my mind I was like, "What the hell..." 😂😂 You were so swift to take the position
                and it was stupid surprising.<br>
                Fast forward to the time in your room when I saw some of your art and I thought you were
                lying when you said you drew them from your head. 👀👀<br>
                Fast forward again to the Sunday with the whole picture thing, and just like that, I became friends with
                one of the most important people in my life right now. <br>
                I love you so much, like guy you don't get. ♥️
                You've been there for me through thick and thin. 
                As much as you're annoying, you're also loving, though you started jealousing me with all the love you're 
                now sharing which should originally belong to me. But I forgive you anyways.
                I just want to wish you the very best as you enter this new year.
                <br>More wisdom, more strength, more money, more sense, more direction,
                more provision, more blessings, more and more and more and...<br>
                lest I forget. More money for me gurlllllll..... 🤑<br>
                May God continue to bless you and grant you all your heart desires, yes, yam included. <br>
                In the next pages, make sure to follow the number directly oh. Don't cheat. God is watching you.
                Enjoy your present birthday girl.
